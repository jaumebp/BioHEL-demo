# Demo dataset
In this folder you have the classic MNIST dataset converted to ARFF format. The names of the training/test files follow the pattern that my scripts like to see to automatically submit experiments. Also here is the config file (test1.conf) for BioHEL

First compile BioHEL-cuda and then, To run BioHEL, type the following ../BioHEL-cuda/biohelcuda test1.conf TrainFold0 TestFold0

The files need to be uncompressed before running BioHEL
