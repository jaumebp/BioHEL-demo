# Demo dataset
In this folder you have the classic MNIST dataset converted to ARFF format. The names of the training/test files follow the pattern that my scripts like to see to automatically submit experiments. Also here is the config file (test1.conf) for BioHEL

The files need to be uncompressed before running BioHEL
